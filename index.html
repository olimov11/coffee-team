            <p class="intro-definition">Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting
               stories of coffee from around
               the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every shipment.

               <h2 class="commitment-title">Our commitment</h2>
               <p class="commitment-definition">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the
                  way. We want to make it easy
                  for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate
                  the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
                  challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers
                  and empower a global community of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer
                  training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
                  finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing
                  region.</p>

               <p class="quality-definition">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of
                  harvest and processing, we
                  employ,
                  on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every
                  bag
                  of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly
                  coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
